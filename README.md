This is an incomplete work! A good idea thought :-)

## Chapters

1. Matrices â€” basic arrays and matrices, visualized

## Viewing

You have two choices:

- Click the `launch binder` button above to view the chapters as interactive
  Jupyter notebooks. The raw source is available in `notebooks/`.

- Download a static rendering of the notebooks in some format. Formats are
  available in `static/` (e.g. `HTML`).

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Nelson Liu for reading drafts of these chapters. Thanks to Colin
Lockard, Elizabeth Clark, John Thickstun, and Lucy Lin for their feedback on
preliminary versions of this material.

### TODOs

- [x] make `list` vs `ndarray` distinction more clear in notebook
- [x] pull visualization helpers into some kinda `util.py`
- [x] wrap plain text at smaller width
- [x] investigate script (w/ `jupyter`?) to generate HTML
- [ ] debug Jupyter `nbconvert` PDF generation
- [ ] check if `mybinder.org` auto-builds new versions. If not, see if there's
  some hook (e.g. github) to do this.
